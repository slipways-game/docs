# Publishing your mod

To publish a mod, you need to package up the folder you created and all the files within and upload them somewhere other people can find. If you're using Steam, the game can take care of this process and upload to Steam Workshop. But even if you're using Steam, please consider also uploading your mod to a publicly accessible mod website (eg. [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/) so that people that don't play on Steam can also access your mod.

## Uploading to Steam Workshop

This is a simple process with most of the details handled by Slipways itself.

* Before uploading, prepare a preview image to accompany your mod. This image should be in **4:3 aspect** and should be saved as a **JPEG**. Copy this file to `preview.jpg` in your mod's subfolder so that the game can find it.
* Go to the mod management window and select your mod. You should see an **"Upload mod"** button in the right panel.
* Click the button. The game will show a preview of what you're uploading. If everything looks correct, click **"Continue"**.
* The game will now upload your mod.
* By default, the mod is uploaded as a private file accessible just to you. To change this, you'll have to go to your mod's **workshop page** and change its visibility to **public**. This also gives you the opportunity to edit other properties of your mod, if you want to.

Once you go through this process once, you can also update the mod using the ingame interface. This works exactly the same, but the button should say **Upload update** for mods already uploaded to the workshop.

## Uploading elsewhere

As mentioned above, we strongly encourage you to also upload your mod to one of the publicly accessible mod websites like [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/). To publish your mod this way:

* Find your mod in the game's mod folder (the path is at the bottom of the mod management window)
* Pack up your mod into a .zip file. You should pack it in such a way that your mod's folder is at the top level in the archive.
* Upload it to your mod website, your private website, or anywhere else you want.
