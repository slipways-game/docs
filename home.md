# Using mods

Mods are managed from the main menu. At the very bottom of the menu, there should be a **"Manage mods"** button. This is the place where you can pick and choose which mods you want to use. But before you can use them, you have to find them.

## Getting mods: Using Steam

If you're playing Slipways on Steam, that's easy. Slipways is integrated with [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1264280/workshop/) and this where you will be able to find most of the game's mods. To get a new mod from the workshop:

* open the **"Manage mods"** interface in-game
* click the **"Find more..." button**, which will take you to the workshop
* **subscribe** to any mods you'd like by clicking the green "+" button close to them
* go back to the game, and click the **"Refresh" button** so that the game notices the new subscriptions
* you should now see the new mods in the window - all that's left is clicking the checkbox on the left of each mod to **enable them**.

You can also subscribe to mods from the Steam application or your browser by going to the workshop manually. In any case, the game will automatically synchronize and update the mods from Steam Workshop whenever you launch the game or use the "Refresh" button in the mod management window.

## Getting mods: No Steam

While Steam Workshop is convenient, it's not required. When you open the mod management window, you should be able to see a "Mod folder:" label just below it, with a path pointing to a folder somewhere on your disk. This is your **mod folder** - any subfolder placed there will be automatically picked up as a mod if it has the correct contents.

So, the steps in this case are:
* get an archive of the mod you want from somewhere (eg. [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/))
* unpack it into your **mod folder**
* open the **"Manage mods"** interface in-game and click **Refresh**
* you should now see the new mods in the window - all that's left is clicking the checkbox on the left of each mod to **enable them**.
